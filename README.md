# üöÄ MLOps Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **MLOps Projects** repository! This repo contains a collection of hands-on, end-to-end projects where I apply MLOps best practices to streamline machine learning workflows using real-world tools and frameworks.

Each project demonstrates different aspects of the MLOps lifecycle ‚Äî from data ingestion and versioning, to model development, CI/CD, containerization, and API deployment.

## üìÅ Projects Included

### ‚úÖ Project 1: Automated File-Based Data Ingestion
- Ingests raw files from a directory and processes them for ML readiness.
- Includes job scheduling and modular data pipelines.

### ‚úÖ Project 2: Essential Python Libraries for MLOps
- Focused on using `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and other key libraries.
- Establishes good code hygiene and packaging standards.

### ‚úÖ Project 3: DVC & GitHub Foundations
- Introduces **Data Version Control (DVC)** to track datasets and model versions.
- Integrates with Git for end-to-end project reproducibility.

### ‚úÖ Project 4: Build and Deploy ML App with FastAPI
- Develops a machine learning model and deploys it as a RESTful API using **FastAPI**.
- Includes request validation and model inference pipeline.

### ‚úÖ Project 5: Docker for MLOps & AI Workloads
- Dockerizes an entire ML workflow from training to serving.
- Emphasizes container best practices for reproducibility and portability.

## üìå Why This Repo?

MLOps is essential for scaling machine learning from notebooks to real-world production systems. These projects reflect my learning and practical experience in:
- Bridging the gap between data science and DevOps
- Automating and scaling ML workflows
- Ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and monitoring
- Building resilient, testable, and deployable ML systems
